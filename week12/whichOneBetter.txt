Which One Is Better:

The choice between Knapsack Branch and Bound and Knapsack Bound may depend on the characteristics of your problem instances.
Knapsack Branch and Bound with the heuristic sorting can be more effective when you have a good heuristic that helps you prioritize items effectively.
Knapsack Bound is a more general approach and can be used when you don't have a specific heuristic or when the heuristic doesn't significantly improve the bound.
In practice, you may want to experiment with both approaches on your specific problem instances to see which one performs better.


Comparison to DP Approach:

Both Knapsack Branch and Bound and Knapsack Bound are potentially more efficient than the DFS approach because they use bounds and pruning strategies to reduce the search space.
However, the DP approach is generally the most efficient and reliable method for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem. It guarantees an optimal solution and has a time complexity of O(N*C), where N is the number of items and C is the knapsack capacity.
The DP approach should be the first choice for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem unless specific characteristics of your problem instances make the other approaches more effective.
